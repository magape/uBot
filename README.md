Some mechanical parts (chassis, motor brackets, and wheels) are 3D printed using available [stl files](https://github.com/magape/uBot/tree/main/3D/stl).
The parts are mechanically assembled with M2 nuts, bolts, and washers. The assembly can be done according to the [pictures](https://github.com/magape/uBot/tree/main/img) showing the step-by-step process.
